1D Music

--------

1D Music allows you to simulate cellular automata and then map the cells to music in 3 different ways.

To run the server locally you must have ruby installed, then clone the repo and run 'bundle install', 'rake db:migrate', then 'rails s', and visit localhost:3000 in a browser.

The latest version is also on heroku at one-d.herokuapp.com

Note: it has only been tested on chrome. YMMV with other browsers
